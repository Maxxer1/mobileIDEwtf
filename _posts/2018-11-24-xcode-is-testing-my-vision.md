There is some days at work when you are asking yourself: am I really seeing this?
After showing this to my coworkers they also agreed that Xcode interface builder was testing our vision.

Xcode started to be little blurry. I thought that is something wrong with my monitor but after moving Xcode window Desktop below was perfectly normal.
