We are group of developers who work in mobile development. And while there is a lot to love about the job - the opportunity to get your hands on latest's findings in mobile hardware and software, for example - a bad tool can make any job a nightmare. And the tools we work with are far from perfect. So far in fact, that we decided to create this website to document and share our daily struggle with our IDEs' odd quirks.

We mostly work with Android Studio, and - of course - Apple's ONE AND ONLY, state-of-the-art creation: Xcode. It will probably be the latter that will provide the most interesting content; however, as we have learned, AS does it best to catch up with Xcode in terms of WTF-ness.
